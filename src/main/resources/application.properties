# This file contains default settings for the application.
# Profile-specific properties (in application-dev.properties, etc.) will
# override the settings in this file.

# --- Default Profile Configuration ---
# Set 'dev' as the default active profile.
# This ensures that 'application-dev.properties' is always loaded by default
# when running the application without specifying a profile via command line.
spring.profiles.active=dev


# --- Default JWT Properties ---
# These values act as a fallback and will be used if they are not
# overridden in a profile-specific file (like application-prod.properties).
# For production, it is a best practice to override these with secure
# environment variables.

# A default, Base64-encoded secret key for development.
